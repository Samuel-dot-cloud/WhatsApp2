The project is a Java Android-platform based chat application that is a near replica of the popular WhatsApp application. The app is maintains the base minimum functionalities of WhatsApp such as a group chat, individual chat, ability to send, receive and delete messages and documents such as PDF, image and MS word files.
One can also view the status of his/her contacts in the contacts section such as being online or offline.
The app has even been tweaked a bit with a Find Friends Section where one is able to find other people using the same app.:medal_military::medal_military::trophy:
